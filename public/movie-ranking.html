    <h3>The Glass Onion</h3>
<p> 
    This was a beautiful and intriguing movie. not only did it bring a huge cast of actors down to earth with the vulnerabilities of their characters,s but it was a visual masterpiece. Finally to take Agatha christie's orgiinal work and still to be able to do justice to it is phenomenol achievement.

<h3> Knives Out</h3>
<p> Another stellar Daniel Craig movie, but Anna De Armas did it for me , or was it Chris Evans?</p>
